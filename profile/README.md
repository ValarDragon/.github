# `arkworks`

`arkworks` is a Rust ecosystem for zkSNARK programming. Libraries in the `arkworks` ecosystem provide efficient implementations of all components required to implement zkSNARK applications, from generic finite fields to R1CS constraints for common functionalities.

## Getting started

Below are some resources for getting started working with `arkworks` crates:

* [Talk at Real World Crypto](https://youtu.be/Bz2KN_h3VKM?t=90) providing an overview of the `arkworks` ecosystem.
* [Tutorial for R1CS programming](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/r1cs-tutorial/) using the `ark-relations`, `ark-r1cs-std`, and `ark-crypto-primitives` crates.
* [Quick introduction to programming with finite fields, elliptic curves, and pairings](https://github.com/Pratyush/algebra-intro) in `arkworks`.
